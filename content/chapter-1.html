									<p>Lesson 2 - Expressions, Data Types, & Variables</p>
								</div>
							</div>
							<p>The Ruby programming language has a wide range of syntactical constructions, standard library functions, and interactive development environment features. Fortunately, you can ignore most of that; you just need to learn enough to write some handy little programs.
							You will, however, have to learn some basic programming concepts before you can do anything. Like a wizard-in-training, you might think these concepts seem arcane and tedious, but with some knowledge and practice, you’ll be able to command your computer like a magic wand to perform incredible feats.</p>
							<p>This chapter has a few examples that encourage you to type into the interactive shell, which lets you execute Ruby instructions one at a time and shows you the results instantly. Using the interactive shell is great for learning what basic Ruby instructions do, so give it a try as you follow along. You’ll remember the things you do much better than the things you only read.</p>

								<h3>Entering Expressions into the Interactive Shell</h3>
								<p>A window with the > prompt should appear; that’s the interactive shell. Enter <b>2 + 2</b> at the prompt to have Python do some simple math.<br>
								><b> 2 + 2</b><br>
								4</p>

								<p>In Ruby, 2 + 2 is called an expression, which is the most basic kind of programming instruction in the language. Expressions consist of values (such as2) and operators (such as +), and they can always evaluate (that is, reduce) down to a single value. That means you can use expressions anywhere in Ruby code that you could also use a value.</p>
								<p>In the previous example, 2 + 2 is evaluated down to a single value, 4. A single value with no operators is also considered an expression, though it evaluates only to itself, as shown here:<br>
								> <b>2</b><br>
								=>2<br>
								Errors are Okay!</p>
								<p>Programs will crash if they contain code the computer can’t understand, which will cause Ruby to show an error message. An error message won’t break your computer, though, so don’t be afraid to make mistakes. A crash just means the program stopped running unexpectedly.</p>
								<p>If you want to know more about an error message, you can search for the exact message text online to find out more about that specific error.
								There are plenty of other operators you can use in Ruby expressions, too. For example, Table 1-1 lists all the math operators in Ruby.
								Table 1-1. Math Operators from Highest to Lowest Precedence.</p>

								</section>

								<p>The order of operations of Ruby math operators is similar to that of mathematics. The ** operator is evaluated first; the *, /, and %operators are evaluated next, from left to right; and the + and - operators are evaluated last (also from left to right). You can use parentheses to override the usual precedence if you need to. Enter the following expressions into the interactive shell:<br>
								> <b>2 + 3 * 6</b><br>
								20<br>
								> <b>(2 + 3) * 6</b><br>
								30<br>
								> <b>48565878 * 578453</b><br>
								28093077826734<br>
								> <b>2 ** 8</b><br>
								256<br>
								> 23 / 7<br>
								3.2857142857142856<br>
								> <b>23</b> % 7<br>
								2<br>
								> <b>2 + 2</b><br>
								4<br>
								> <b>(5 - 1) * ((7 + 1) / (3 - 1))</b><br>
								16.0
								</p>

								<p>In each case, you as the programmer must enter the expression, but Ruby does the hard part of evaluating it down to a single value. Ruby will keep evaluating parts of the expression until it becomes a single value, as shown in Figure 1-1.</p>
								<div class="box alt">
									<div class="row 50% uniform">
										<div class="4u  6u(xsmall)"><span class="image fit"><img src="../images/chapter-0/image02.png" alt="" /></span></div>
									</div>
								</div>
								<p>Figure 1-1. Evaluating an expression reduces it to a single value.
								These rules for putting operators and values together to form expressions are a fundamental part of Ruby as a programming language, just like the grammar rules that help us communicate. Here’s an example:</p>
								<ul>
									<li><b>This is a grammatically correct English sentence.</b></li>
									<li><b>This grammatically is sentence not English correct a.</b></li>
								</ul>
								<p>The second line is difficult to parse because it doesn’t follow the rules of English. Similarly, if you type in a bad Ruby instruction, Ruby won’t be able to understand it and will display a SyntaxError error message.</p>

								<p>You can always test to see whether an instruction works by typing it into the interactive shell. Don’t worry about breaking the computer: The worst thing that could happen is that Ruby responds with an error message. Professional software developers get error messages while writing code all the time.</p>

									<h3>The Integer, Floating-Point, and String Data Types</h3>
								</header>
								<p>Remember that expressions are just values combined with operators, and they always evaluate down to a single value. A data type is a category for values, and every value belongs to exactly one data type. The most common data types in Ruby are listed in Table 1-2. The values -2 and 30, for example, are said to be integer values. The integer (or int) data type indicates values that are whole numbers. Numbers with a decimal point, such as 3.14, are called floating-point numbers (or floats). Note that even though the value 42 is an integer, the value42.0 would be a floating-point number.</p>
								<section class="centro">
									<div class="table-wrapper">
										<table>
											<tr>
											  <td><strong>Data Type</strong></td>
											  <td><strong>Examples</strong></td>
											</tr>
											 
											<tr>
											  <td>Intergers</td>
											  <td>-2,-1,0,1,2,3,4,5</td>
											</tr>
											 
											<tr>
											  <td>Floating-point numbers</td>
											  <td>-1.25, -1.0, --0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.25</td>
											</tr>

											<tr>
											  <td>Strings</td>
											  <td>'a', 'aa', 'aaa', 'Hello!', '11 cats'</td>
											</tr>
										</table>
									</div>
								</section>
								<p>Python programs can also have text values called strings. Always surround your string in single quote (') characters (as in 'Hello'or 'Goodbye cruel world!') so Ruby knows where the string begins and ends. You can even have a string with no characters in it, '', called a blank string. Strings are explained in greater detail in <span class="color"><a href="file:///Users/israel/Desktop/Trabajos/automatestuffwithruby/chapter-4.html">Chapter 4.</a></span></p>

								<h3>String Concatenation and Replication</h3>
								<p>TThe meaning of an operator may change based on the data types of the values next to it. For example, + is the addition operator when it operates on two integers or floating-point values. However, when + is used on two string values, it joins the strings as the string concatenation operator. Enter the following into the interactive shell:<br>
								> <b>'Alice' + 'Bob'</b><br>
								'AliceBob'<br>
								The expression evaluates down to a single, new string value that combines the text of the two strings. However, if you try to use the + operator on a string and an integer value, Python will not know how to handle this, and it will display an error message.</p>
								<p>
								>>> <b>'Alice' + 42</b><br>
								TypeError: no implicit conversion of Fixnum into String<br>
								<span class="tab"></span><span class="tab"></span> from (irb):3:in `+'<br>
								<span class="tab"></span><span class="tab"></span> from (irb):3</p>
								
								<p>TypeError: Can't convert 'int' object to str implicitly
								The error message Can't convert 'int' object to str implicitly means that Ruby thought you were trying to concatenate an integer to the string 'Alice'. Your code will have to explicitly convert the integer to a string, because Ruby cannot do this automatically. (Converting data types will be explained in Dissecting Your Program when talking about the string(), integer(), and float()functions.)</p>
								<p>The * operator is used for multiplication when it operates on two integer or floating-point values. But when the * operator is used on one string value and one integer value, it becomes the string replication operator. Enter a string multiplied by a number into the interactive shell to see this in action.<br>
								> <b>'Alice' * 5</b><br>
								'AliceAliceAliceAliceAlice'<br>
								The expression evaluates down to a single string value that repeats the original a number of times equal to the integer value. String replication is a useful trick, but it’s not used as often as string concatenation.</p>
								<p>The * operator can be used with only two numeric values (for multiplication) or one string value and one integer value (for string replication). Otherwise, Ruby will just display an error message.<br>
								> <b>'Alice' * 'Bob'</b><br>
								TypeError: no implicit conversion of String into Integer<br>
								<span class="tab"></span><span class="tab">from (irb):10:in<br>
								<span class="tab"></span>'Alice' * 'Bob'</p>

								<p>It makes sense that Ruby  wouldn’t understand these expressions: You can’t multiply two words, and it’s hard to replicate an arbitrary string a fractional number of times.</p>

									<h3>Storing Values in Variables</h3>
									<p> A <span style="font-style: italic;">variable</span> is like a box in the computer’s memory where you can store a single value. If you want to use the result of an evaluated expression later in your program, you can save it inside a variable</p>
								</header>
								<h4>Assignment Statements</h4>
								<p>You’ll store values in variables with an assignment statement. An assignment statement consists of a variable name, an equal sign (called the assignment operator), and the value to be stored. If you enter the assignment statement spam = 42, then a variable named spam will have the integer value 42 stored in it.
								Think of a variable as a labeled box that a value is placed in, as in Figure 1-2.</p>
								<div class="box alt">
									<div class="row 50% uniform">
										<div class="4u  6u(xsmall)"><span class="image fit"><img src="../images/chapter-0/image01.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>
									</div>
								</div>
								<p>Figure 1-2. spam = 42 is like telling the program, “The variable spam now has the integer value 42 in it.”<br>
								For example, enter the following into the interactive shell:<br>
								> <b>spam = 40</b><br>
								<span class="tab"></span><span class="tab">> <b>spam</b><br>
								<span class="tab"></span><span class="tab"> 40<br>
								<span class="tab"></span><span class="tab"><span class="tab"></span>> <b>eggs = 2</b><br>
								<span class="tab"></span><span class="tab"><span class="tab"></span>> <b>spam + eggs</b><br>
								<span class="tab"></span><span class="tab"> 42<br>
								<span class="tab"></span><span class="tab"><span class="tab"></span>> <b>spam + eggs + spam</b><br>
								<span class="tab"></span><span class="tab"><span class="tab"></span>82<br>
								<span class="tab"></span> <b>spam = spam + 2</b><br>
								<span class="tab"></span>> <b>spam</b><br>
								<span class="tab"></span>42
								</p>
								<p>A variable is initialized (or created) the first time a value is stored in it ❶. After that, you can use it in expressions with other variables and values ❷. When a variable is assigned a new value ③, the old value is forgotten, which is why spamevaluated to 42 instead of 40 at the end of the example. This is called overwritingthe variable. Enter the following code into the interactive shell to try overwriting a string:<br>
								> <b>spam</b> = <b>'Hello'</b><br>
								<span class="tab"></span>> <b>spam</b><br>
								<span class="tab"></span><span class="tab"></span>'Hello'<br>
								<span class="tab"></span>> <b>spam</b> = <b>'Goodbye'</b><br>
								<span class="tab"></span>> <b>spam</b><br>
								<span class="tab"></span><span class="tab"></span>'Goodbye'</p>
								<p>Just like the box in Figure 1-3, the spam variable in this example stores 'Hello'until you replace it with 'Goodbye'.</p>
								<div class="box alt">
									<div class="row 50% uniform">
										<div class="4u  6u(xsmall)"><span class="image fit"><img src="../images/chapter-0/image17.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>
									</div>
								</div>

								<h3>Variable Names</h3>
								<p>Table 1-3 has examples of legal variable names. You can name a variable anything as long as it obeys the following three rules:</p>
								<ol>
									<li>It can be only one word.</li>
									<li>It can use only letters, numbers, and the underscore (_) character.</li>
									<li>It can’t begin with a number.</li>
								</ol>
								Table 1-3. Valid and Invalid Variable Names</p>
								<section class="centro">
									<div class="table-wrapper">
										<table>
											<tr>
											  <td><strong>Valid variable names</strong></td>
											  <td><strong>Invalid variable names</strong></td>
											</tr>
											 
											<tr>
											  <td>balance</td>
											  <td>current-balance (hyphens are not allowed)</td>
											</tr>
											 
											<tr>
											  <td>currentBalance</td>
											  <td>current balance (spaces are not allowed)</td>
											</tr>

											<tr>
											  <td>current_balance</td>
											  <td>4account (can’t begin with a number)</td>
											</tr>

											<tr>
											  <td>_spam</td>
											  <td>42 (can’t begin with a number)</td>
											</tr>

											<tr>
											  <td>SPAM</td>
											  <td>total_$um (special characters like $ are not allowed)</td>
											</tr>

											<tr>
											  <td>account4</td>
											  <td>'hello' (special characters like ' are not allowed)</td>
											</tr>
										</table>
									</div>
								</section>

								<p>Variable names are case-sensitive, meaning that spam, SPAM, Spam, and sPaM are four different variables. It is a Ruby convention to start your variables with a lowercase letter.</p>
								<p>This book uses camelcase for variable names instead of underscores; that is, variables lookLikeThis instead of looking_like_this. In your programs, a descriptive name will help make your code more readable.</p>

								<h2>Your First Program</h2>

									<p> Lesson 3 - Your First Program</p>
								</div>
							</div>
								<p>While the interactive shell is good for running Ruby instructions one at a time, to write entire Ruby programs, you’ll type the instructions into the file editor. The file editor is similar to text editors such as SublimeText or SublimeText :D.</p>

								<p>Now it’s time to create your first program! When the file editor window opens, type the following into it:<br><br></p>
								<p>❶ # This program says hello and asks for my name.</p>

								<p>❷ puts “Hello world!”<br>
								<span class="tab"></span>puts “What is your name?”    # ask for their name</p>

								<p>③ myName = gets.chomp</p>


								<p>④ puts “It is good to meet you, #{myName}”</p>


								<p>⑤ myName = myName.length<br>
								<span class="tab"></span>puts "The length of your name is: #{myName}" </p>

								<p>⑥ puts “What is your age?”   # ask for their age<br>
								<span class="tab"></span>myAge = gets.to_i<br>
								<span class="tab"></span>myAge = myAge + 1<br>
								<span class="tab"></span>puts “You will be  #{myAge}   in a year”</p>

								<p>Once you’ve entered your source code, save it so that you won’t have to retype it each time you start IDLE. From the menu at the top of the file editor window, select <b>File▸Save As</b>. In the Save As window, enter <b>hello.rb</b> in the File Name field and then click <b>Save.</b></p>
								<p>You should save your programs every once in a while as you type them. That way, if the computer crashes or you accidentally exit from IDLE, you won’t lose the code. As a shortcut, you can press CTRL-S on Windows and Linux or ⌘-S on OS X to save your file.</p>
								<p>Once you’ve saved, let’s run our program. Your program should run in the interactive shell window that appeared when you first started IDLE. The program’s output in the interactive shell should look something like this:</p>

								<p>Hello world!<br>
								What is your name?<br>
								<b>Al</b><br>
								It is good to meet you, Al<br>
								The length of your name is:<br>
								2<br>
								What is your age?<br>
								<b>4</b><br>
								You will be 5 in a year.</p>


								<p>When there are no more lines of code to execute, the Ruby program terminates; that is, it stops running. (You can also say that the Ruby program exits.)</p>
								<p>You can close the file editor by clicking the X at the top of the window. To reload a saved program, select <b>File▸Open</b> from the menu. Do that now, and in the window that appears, choose <b>hello.rb</b>, and click the <b>Open</b> button. Your previously saved hello.rb program should open in the file editor window.</p>
		

								<hr />

							</section>
							<section class="centro">
								<h3>Dissecting Your Program</h3>
								<p>With your new program open in the file editor, let’s take a quick tour of the Ruby instructions it uses by looking at what each line of code does.</p>
								<h4>Comments</h4>
								<p>The following line is called a comment.<br>
								❶ # This program says hello and asks for my name.
								Ruby ignores comments, and you can use them to write notes or remind yourself what the code is trying to do. Any text for the rest of the line following a hash mark (#) is part of a comment.</p>
								<p>Sometimes, programmers will put a # in front of a line of code to temporarily remove it while testing a program. This is called commenting out code, and it can be useful when you’re trying to figure out why a program doesn’t work. You can remove the # later when you are ready to put the line back in.</p>
								<p>Ruby also ignores the blank line after the comment. You can add as many blank lines to your program as you want. This can make your code easier to read, like paragraphs in a book.</p>
								<h4>The puts Function</h4>
								<p>The puts  function displays the string value inside on the screen.<br>
								❷ puts “Hello world!”<br>
								<span class="tab"></span>puts “What is your name?” # ask for their name<br>
								The line puts “Hello world!” means “Print out the text in the string 
								“Hello world!”. When Ruby executes this line, you say that Ruby is calling the puts function and the string value is being passed to the function. A value that is passed to a function call is an argument. Notice that the quotes are not printed to the screen. They just mark where the string begins and ends; they are not part of the string value.</p>

								<h4>The gets.chomp Function</h4>
								<p>The gets.chomp function waits for the user to type some text on the keyboard and press ENTER.<br>
								③ myName = gets.chomp<br>
								This function call evaluates to a string equal to the user’s text, and the previous line of code assigns the myName variable to this string value.
								You can think of the gets.chomp function call as an expression that evaluates to whatever string the user typed in. If the user entered 'Al', then the expression would evaluate to myName = 'Al'.</p>

								<h4>Printing the User’s Name</h4>
								<p>The following call to puts actually contains the expression 'It is good to meet you, ' and myName by this #{variable}’ inside the quotation marks.<br>
								④ puts ”It is good to meet you, ' #{myName}”<br>
								Remember that expressions can always evaluate to a single value. If 'Al' is the value stored in myName on the previous line, then this expression evaluates to 'It is good to meet you, Al'. This single string value is then passed to puts , which prints it on the screen.</p>

								<h4>The length Function</h4>
								<p>You can pass the length function a string value (or a variable containing a string), and the function evaluates to the integer value of the number of characters in that string.<br>
								⑤ puts ” The length of your name is:”<br>
								myName = myName.length<br>
								<span class="tab"></span>puts myName<br>
								Enter the following into the interactive shell to try this:<br>
								<span class="tab"></span>> <b>variable</b> = <b>“name”</b><br>
								<b>variable.length</b><br>
								<span class="tab"></span>4<br>
								<span class="tab"></span>>   <b>variable</b> = <b>“My very energetic monster just scarfed nachos”</b><br>
								<span class="tab"></span><span class="tab"></span><b>variable.length</b><br>
								 <span class="tab"></span><span class="tab"></span><span class="tab"></span>46 </p>
								    
								<p>Just like those examples, length evaluates to an integer. It is then passed to puts to be displayed on the screen. Notice that puts allows you to pass it either integer values or string values. But notice the error that shows up when you type the following into the interactive shell:<br>
								<span class="tab"></span><span class="tab"></span>> <b>puts “I am ' <b><< 29 << '</b></b> years old.”<br>
								SyntaxError: (irb):7: syntax error, unexpected tIDENTIFIER<br>
								<span class="tab"></span><span class="tab"></span>puts “I am ' + 29 + ' years old.”<br>
								TypeError: Can't convert 'int' object to str implicitly<br>
								The puts function isn’t causing that error, but rather it’s the expression you tried to pass to puts. You get the same error message if you type the expression into the interactive shell on its own.<br>
								<span class="tab"></span><span class="tab"></span>> SyntaxError: (irb):7: syntax error, unexpected <br>
								<span class="tab"></span><span class="tab"></span><b>“I am ' + 29 + ' years old.”</b></p>
								 
								<p>TypeError: Can't convert 'int' object to str implicitly
								Ruby gives an error because you can use the + operator only to add two integers together or concatenate two strings. You can’t add an integer to a string because this is ungrammatical in Ruby. You can fix this by using a string version of the integer instead, as explained in the next section.</p>

								<h4>The to_string, to_integer, and to_float  Functions</h4>
								<p>If you want to concatenate an integer such as 29 with a string to pass to puts, you’ll need to get the value '29', which is the string form of 29. The to_s  function can be passed an integer value and will evaluate to a string value version of it, as follows:
								     <b>>var = 30</b>
								       <b>var.to_s</b>
								        “29”
								     > <b>puts “I am #{var} years old.”</b>
								I am 29 years old.</p>
								<p>Because to_s evaluates to “29”, the expression 'I am #{var}  years old.' evaluates to 'I am ' '29'  ' years old.', which in turn evaluates to 'I am 29 years old.'. This is the value that is passed to the puts function.</p>
								<p>The to_s, to_int or to_i , and to_f  functions will evaluate to the string, integer, and floating-point forms of the value you pass, respectively. Try converting some values in the interactive shell with these functions, and watch what happens.<br>
								<span class="tab"></span>> <b>var = 0</b><br>
								<span class="tab"></span><span class="tab"></span><b>var.to_s</b><br>
								<span class="tab"></span>'0'<br>
								<span class="tab"></span>> <b>var = -3.14</b><br>
								<span class="tab"></span><span class="tab"></span><b>var.to_s</b><br>
								<span class="tab"></span><span class="tab"></span>'-3.14'<br>
								    


								> <b>var = “42”</b> <br>
								<span class="tab"></span><b>var.to_i</b><br>
								<span class="tab"></span>42<br>
								> <b>var = “-99”</b> <br>
								<span class="tab"></span><b>var.to_i</b><br>
								<span class="tab"></span>-99<br>
								> <b>var = 1.25</b> <br>
								<span class="tab"></span><b>var.to_i</b><br>
								<span class="tab"></span>1<br>
								 > <b>var = 1.99</b><br>
								<span class="tab"></span><b>var.to_i</b><br>
								<span class="tab"></span>1<br>
								  > <b>var = “3.14"</b><br>
								<span class="tab"></span><b>var.to_f</b><br>
								<span class="tab"></span>3.14<br>
								  > <b>var = 10</b><br>
								<span class="tab"></span><b>var.to_f</b><br>
								<span class="tab"></span>10.0</p>

								<p>The previous examples call the to_s, to_i, and to_f  functions and pass them values of the other data types to obtain a string, integer, or floating-point form of those values.</p>
								<p>The to_s function is handy when you have an integer or float that you want to concatenate to a string. The to_i function is also helpful if you have a number as a string value that you want to use in some mathematics. For example, the gets.chomp function always returns a string, even if the user enters a number. Enter <b>spam = gets.chomp</b> into the interactive shell and enter 101 when it waits for your text.<br>
								> <b>spam = gets.chomp</b><br>
								101<br>
								> <b>spam</b><br>
								“101”</p>
								<p>The value stored inside spam isn’t the integer 101 but the string “101”. If you want to do math using the value in spam, use the to_i function to get the integer form of spam and then store this as the new value in spam. you have to use to_i instead .chomp let’s see.<br>
								> <b>spam = gets.to_i</b><br>
								> spam<br>
								101<br>
								Now you should be able to treat the spam variable as an integer instead of a string.<br>
								> spam * 10 / 5<br>
								202.0</p>

								<p>The int() function is also useful if you need to round a floating-point number down. If you want to round a floating-point number up, just add 1 to it afterward.<br>
								> var = 7.7 <br>
								<span class="tab"></span><b>var.to_i + 1</b><br>
								<span class="tab"></span>8 
								</p>

								<p>In your program, you used the to_i and to_s functions in the last three lines to get a value of the appropriate data type for the code.<br>
								⑥ puts “What is your age?”  # ask for their age<br>
								<span class="tab"></span>myAge = gets.chomp <br>
								<span class="tab"></span><span class="tab"></span>myAge.to_i + 1<br>
								<span class="tab"></span>puts “You will be #{myAge} in a year.”</p>

								<p>The myAge variable contains the value returned from gets.chomp. Because the gets.chomp function always returns a string (even if the user typed in a number), you can use the myAge.to_i code to return an integer value of the string in myAge. This integer value is then added to 1 in the expression myAge.to_i + 1</p>
								<p>You will be 'and ' in a year.' to evaluate to one large string value. This large string is finally passed to puts to be displayed on the screen.
								Let’s say the user enters the string '4' for myAge. The string '4' is converted to an integer, so you can add one to it. The result is 5. These evaluation steps would look something like Figure 1-4.
								Text and Number Equivalence</p>
								<p>Although the string value of a number is considered a completely different value from the integer or floating-point version, an integer can be equal to a floating point.
								> <b>42</b> == <b>'42'</b><br>
								False<br>
								> <b>42 == 42.0</b><br>
								True
								</p>

								<h3>Summary</h3>
								<p>You can compute expressions with a calculator or type string concatenations with a word processor. You can even do string replication easily by copying and pasting text. But expressions, and their component values—operators, variables, and function calls—are the basic building blocks that make programs. Once you know how to handle these elements, you will be able to instruct Ruby to operate on large amounts of data for you.</p>
								<p>It is good to remember the different types of operators (+, -, *, /, //, %, and ** for math operations, and + and * for string operations) and the three data types (integers, floating-point numbers, and strings) introduced in this chapter.</p>
								<p>A few different functions were introduced as well. The puts and gets.chomp functions handle simple text output (to the screen) and gets.chomp (from the keyboard). The length function takes a string and evaluates to an int of the number of characters in the string. The to_s, te_i, and to_f  functions will evaluate to the string, integer, or floating-point number form of the value they are passed.</p>
								<p>In the next chapter, you will learn how to tell Ruby to make intelligent decisions about what code to run, what code to skip, and what code to repeat based on the values it has. This is known as flow control, and it allows you to write programs that make intelligent decisions.</p>
